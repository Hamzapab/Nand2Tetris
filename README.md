# Nand2Tetris Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository documenting my progress through the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). This course, based on the book *The Elements of Computing Systems* by Nisan and Schocken, walks through building a computer from scratch—starting with logic gates and culminating in a full-fledged computer system with an operating system.

## 🌟 About the Course
Nand2Tetris is a hands-on course where participants:
- Design basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT.
- Build a simple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and a CPU.
- Write a high-level programming language compiler.
- Develop a basic operating system.
- Simulate running software on the created computer.

## 📂 Repository Structure

## 🌱 Why I'm Taking This Course
I’m passionate about understanding how computers work at a fundamental level. This course provides the unique 
opportunity to demystify the abstraction layers of modern computing by creating each component from scratch.

## 🤝 Contributing
While this is a personal journey, I’d love feedback, suggestions, or collaboration. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
